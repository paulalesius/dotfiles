* Decommissioned repository
Ended up with too much security-sensitive data to further push publically.

* Dotfiles
My GuixSD/Emacs configuration.

Looks great, works great, and is a lot of fun! ðŸ‘Œ

My idiomatic $HOME/.config aka "dotfiles". It is idiomatic in the sense that everything will be configured where it is meant to be configured. For instance:

- variables for the Emacs daemon in the service file that starts it.
- Emacs is activated through emacs.socket
- Emacs Exwm is started with $HOME/.config/exwm/exwm.sh
- Doom module for all exwm-related configurations, other configs for sparse tweaks/configs
- git global $HOME/.gitconfig lives in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
