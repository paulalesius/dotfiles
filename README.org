* Dotfiles
So I finally made the switch to GNU Guix, my systems and user configurations will be residing in this repo. Not much to see here, yet.

Will be creating a proper literate config once I settle-in with Guix :}

My idiomatic $HOME/.config aka "dotfiles". It is idiomatic in the sense that everything will be configured where it is meant to be configured. For instance:

- variables for the Emacs daemon in the service file that starts it.
- Emacs is activated through emacs.socket
- Emacs Exwm is started with $HOME/.config/exwm/exwm.sh
- Doom module for all exwm-related configurations, other configs for sparse tweaks/configs
- git global $HOME/.gitconfig lives in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
